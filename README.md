# Android App for Use with Mobile Health Monitor

## Description
This Android application was developed in the course of my role as Embedded Systems Lead on my UCSB Computer Engineering Capstone Team. In this role, I worked to design and implement a wearable health monitor. This application is intended to be paired with this health monitor in order to receive, process, and display data. While optimized for the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6, this app is compatible with any Android device with a minimum API level of 27.
